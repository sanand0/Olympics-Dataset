## Dataset info & collection process

This data comes from [olympedia.org](https://www.olympedia.org/) and was web scraped with the Python Beautiful Soup library (see [scrape_data.py](./scrape_data.py))

- [athletes/bios.csv](./athletes/bios.csv) contains the raw biographical information on each athlete<br/>
- [results/results.csv](./results/results.csv) contains a row-by-row breakdown of each event athletes competed in and their results in that event.
- [update_results.py](./update_results.py) updates the result files from Olympedia's edition result pages. Downloads are cached under `.cache/` so interrupted updates can resume.

Note, in the process of scraping this dataset, temporary CSV files were created to checkpoint scraping progress. For simplicity these checkpointed files have since been removed from the repository.

## Clean Data

Easier to analyze data can be found in [clean-data/](./clean-data/) folder. In addition to the results and bios info, you can find data files with additional lat/long location data for athletes, NOC region codes, and historic populations of countries over time.
